# Stork - Alpha

:rocket: Leveraging Social Identity for Transacting Digital Assets

Stork is a project developed during the ETHDenver 2023 Hackathon that aims to enable anyone on Twitter to leverage their social identity for transacting digital assets. It utilizes newly released Chainlink Functions for Twitter identity verification and is [deployed on Polygon Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x15f9b27af099d9eebd8a2f47f674a0bc03b68890).

The goal of Stork is to allow users to send digital assets to a Twitter handle. To achieve this, Stork uses Chainlink Functions to map the Twitter handle to an on-chain address.

> :large_orange_diamond: Attention! Stork is a hackathon project, and its smart contracts are not audited and are not meant to run on production. Users should use Stork at their own risk.

## How it works?

Bob wants to send `10 MATIC` to `@elonmusk`, however, it is not possible to send funds to a Twitter handle directly in a blockchain network. An external "authority" is needed to map the Twitter handle to an on-chain destination, that is, an address that can receive funds on the blockchain. This is where recently released ChainLink functions come into play:

> Chainlink Functions provides your smart contracts with access to a trust-minimized compute infrastructure. Your smart contract sends your code to a Decentralized Oracle Network (DON), and each DONâ€™s oracle runs the same code in a serverless environment. The DON aggregates all the independent runs and returns the final result to your smart contract. Your code can be anything from simple computation to fetching data from API providers. 
> 
> Check out [Chainlink Functions Official Documentation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions).


We developed a [Javascript function](/chainlink-functions/stork-twitter.js) that requires the user's Twitter access token to call the Twitter API to retrieve the Twitter handle. The code will then be sent to the [Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts/) for independent nodes to run the same code, obtain the Twitter handle, and reach a consensus before writing it back to the Stork contract. This construct will enable trust-minimized mapping of the Twitter handle to an on-chain address, thus facilitating the successful transfer to the intended recipient.

Returning to the scenario at hand, Bob aims to send `10 MATIC` to `@elonmusk`. To facilitate this transaction, Bob calls the Stork contract, providing `10 MATIC` and a Twitter handle associated with the intended recipient.

[Stork.sol#L105](chainlink-functions/contracts/Stork.sol#L105)
```solidity
sendToTwitterHandle(string calldata handle) public payable
```

To claim the assets transferred to the @elonmusk handle, @elonmusk must first prove ownership of the handle and link it to his/her on-chain address. This process involves calling the Stork contract, which verifies ownership and establishes the mapping between the handle and the on-chain address.

[Stork.sol#L137](/chainlink-functions/contracts/Stork.sol#L137)
```solidity
function claimTwitterHandle(
 string calldata expectedTwitterHandle,
 string calldata accessToken,
 bool claimFundsImmediately) public
```

Upon calling the Stork contract, the associated [Javascript code](/chainlink-functions/stork-twitter.js) is sent to the DON - nodes execute the code and [write the result to the contract](/chainlink-functions/contracts/Stork.sol#L75). Through this process, the contract verifies that the `msg.Sender` owns the @elonmusk handle and establishes the mapping between the handle and the on-chain address.

Once this verification is complete, the user can claim the funds by calling the Stork contract.

[Stork.sol#L158](/chainlink-functions/contracts/Stork.sol#L158)
```solidity
function claimFunds() public
```

The purpose of this function is to determine if `msg.Sender` has an associated Twitter handle. If a handle is found, the function will proceed to release the previously locked funds to the specified handle.

To prevent the need for multiple transactions, the `claimFundsImmediately` parameter can be set to `true` during the initial `claimTwitterHandle` call. Doing so will allow the funds to be claimed immediately after the Twitter handle is successfully verified and mapped to the on-chain address, without requiring any further interaction with the contract.

## AccessToken privacy

[Stork.sol#L137](/chainlink-functions/contracts/Stork.sol#L137)
```solidity
function claimTwitterHandle(
 string calldata expectedTwitterHandle,
 >>> string calldata accessToken, <<<<
 bool claimFundsImmediately) public
```

The current implementation passes the user's access token in plain text, which poses a significant security risk as the token is accessible to the public. While access tokens are only valid for a limited time and provide read-only access, this approach still exposes users' privacy.

To address this issue, we propose a solution that encrypts the access token before transmitting it over the network. This approach involves the following steps:

1. Stork generates a public/private key pair, with the private key shared between the DON nodes using [Offchain Secrets](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-use-secrets-offchain).
2. The public key is publicly shared.
3. Whenever a user wants to interact with the Stork contract, they must encrypt the access token using the public key and transmit it over the network.
4. The Chainlink javascript function will receive the encrypted access token, as well as the off-chain secret private key, which can be used to decrypt the access token and call Twitter.
   
While this solution offers improved security, it is currently not possible to implement due to the beta status of Chainlink functions, which currently only support vanilla javascript functions. However, once basic cryptographic functionality is added, this solution can be implemented to enhance the security and privacy of users.

## Expected Twitter Handle

[Stork.sol#L137](/chainlink-functions/contracts/Stork.sol#L137)
```solidity
function claimTwitterHandle(
 >>> string calldata expectedTwitterHandle, <<<
 string calldata accessToken,
 bool claimFundsImmediately) public
```

The claim transaction requires the user to provide the expected Twitter handle along with the access token. This provides a layer of protection as once the DON network comes to a consensus on the actual Twitter handle associated with the access token, it is checked against the expected handle. This eliminates any doubt the user may have about DON network unexpectedly deciding on the wrong Twitter handle.

## Emmbeded JS code

[Stork.sol#L23](/chainlink-functions/contracts/Stork.sol#L23)
```solidity
...
string internal constant FUNCTION_CODE =
    "const twitterAccessToken = args[0];\n"
    "if (!twitterAccessToken) {\n"
    "  throw Error('AccessToken is required.');\n"
...
```

The DON network operates by having its nodes execute a provided JavaScript code. In order to make the interaction between users and the Stork contract more transparent, we have [embedded the JavaScript code](/chainlink-functions/contracts/Stork.sol#L23) inside the smart contract. This allows users to easily view the code that will be executed by the DON nodes.

## Run, deploy and test

```

## Conclusion

Stork is a promising project that aims to leverage social identity for transacting digital assets. While it is not ready for production use, it provides a solid foundation for further development and exploration of the use of Chainlink Functions for on-chain social identity verification.
